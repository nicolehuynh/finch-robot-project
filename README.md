# Final Project: Finch Robot Challenges

## Essential Question
How can we apply object-oriented programming principles and Java concepts to create interactive, autonomous robot behaviors that solve real-world challenges?

## Project Overview
In this project-based learning experience, you will program a Finch 2.0 robot to perform one of three challenges:
1. Choreograph a dance routine (with movement, lights, and sound)
2. Create an artistic drawing using the robot's movements
3. Navigate a maze autonomously

Your program must demonstrate your understanding of Java programming concepts from APCSA and object-oriented design principles while creating an engaging robot behavior.

## Learning Objectives
- Apply Java programming concepts in a physical computing context
- Implement object-oriented design principles
- Develop problem-solving skills through algorithm development
- Create well-documented and maintainable code
- Practice technical communication through presentations and documentation

## Choice of Design
We chose to do the dance challenge. Our goal was to make our finch dance, change the tail colors, have a colored beak, and play some notes. This was done by using for-loops and arrays, which helped the finch dance and play different notes. 

## Challenges
One challenge we faced was getting the project started because we knew what we wanted the finch to do, but the website was new and unfamiliar to us. We struggled with being able to navigate around the website, but with practice and exploring the tools that the website has, we were able to get more familiar with the website and navigate through it easier. We also had a hard time with making the finch play a song because the notes had to be individually created, causing it to be a long process. Instead, we chose to make the finch play different notes, creating our own music. 

## Future Enhancements
If we had more time to work on this project, we would have made the finch sing an actual song with the notes. We would also have cleaned up the code by making it less redundant and using more for-loops, arrays, and if-statements. This would allow the code to be more complex, but cleaner and easier to read.
